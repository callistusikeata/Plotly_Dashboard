# Plotly_Dashboard

The purpose of this analysis is to create a dynamic dashboard that includes demographic information and bacterial data for each volunteer. The analysis is made up of three charts: a bar chart that shows the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the belly button, a bubble chart that portrays the amount of bacteria cultures per sample, and a gauge chart that reveals the number of times a volunteer washes his or her belly button. By choosing a volunteer (UTO ID) in the dropdown menu, users can view the differences across multiple test subjects
